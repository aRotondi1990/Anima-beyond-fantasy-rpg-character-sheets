# Anima-beyond-fantasy-rpg-character-sheets
Repository for custom character sheets for use with Anima: Beyond Fantasy tabletop roleplaying game

These are made with simple functional design in mind and are uploaded in the .xcf format for finished assets and components to be usable and modifyable by those wishing to improve them with free software such as GIMP. They are also minimally stylized to be reminiscent of the original character sheets from the tabletop roleplaying game, with use of the Morpheus font being the primary example.
